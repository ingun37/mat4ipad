## Motivation

Open-source, Interactive, Expressive, Algebraic Calculator.

I originally made this application to help myself to solve the exercises from "Elementary Linear Algebra" by Ron Larson.

It's algebraic which means you can define variables and use it the expressions.

It's interactive. You will find writing expressions fun in this application. For example it supports limited handwriting which means you can handwrite integers in matrix( which was 90% of the job when I was solving practices from the book). Also you can type simple expressions like `-4^3`, `3x`, `5/x`, `x+y`.

This is completely open source. You can change the app, bug report, feature request in https://github.com/ingun37/mat4ipad
